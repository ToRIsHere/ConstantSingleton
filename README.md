# ConstantSingleton by Swift
[Singleton pattern](http://www.galloway.me.uk/tutorials/singleton-classes/) is a design pattern that restricts 
the instance of a class to only one object. 

## When to use
When you wanted to share data between different parts of code, instead of having to pass the data around. For example,
global setting constant such as locale, language, currency etc.
